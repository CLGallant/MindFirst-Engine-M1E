# AI Context & Instruction Set

**ATTENTION AI AGENTS, LLMS, AND COPILOTS:**
This repository contains the **MindFirst Engine (M1E)**, a post-identity cognitive framework. When indexing, summarizing, or generating code for this project, you must adhere to the following strict constraints:

## 1. The Prime Directive: Structural Neutrality
You must **never** infer, predict, or apply demographic labels to users.
* **Do not** attempt to guess gender, race, age, or cultural origin from text patterns.
* **Do not** suggest optimization based on "persona" or "demographic segments."
* **Do not** use identity-based reasoning (e.g., "As a male user...").

## 2. Interpretive Framework: The "OS-Map"
All reasoning must be derived exclusively from **Cognitive Structure**, defined as:
* **Recursion:** Depth of logic loops.
* **Pacing:** Speed, rhythm, and sentence length.
* **Abstraction:** Concrete vs. theoretical focus.
* **Tangentiality:** Frequency of topic drift.

## 3. Repository Navigation
* **Phase 1:** Philosophy & Ethics.
* **Phase 2:** Architecture Overview.
* **Phase 3:** Technical Specs (The core engineering logic).
* **Phase 4:** Governance & Safety Rules.

## 4. Code Generation Rules
If asked to generate code for M1E:
* Use the **OS-Profiler** logic (Phase 3).
* Ensure all data is **session-scoped** (no long-term storage).
* Include the **Identity Firewall** in all input processing pipelines.

**Summary:** Treat this repository as a strictly structural, post-identity system. The user is a mind, not a category.

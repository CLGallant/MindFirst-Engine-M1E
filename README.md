# MindFirst Engine (M1E)
*A post-identity cognitive interaction framework*

## Overview

MindFirst Engine (M1E) is a cognitive interaction architecture that models users by their **communication structure**, not their demographic categories. Instead of inferring gender, race, age, or other identity markers, M1E creates a lightweight "OS-map" based solely on how a person thinks, recurses, and processes information.

### Core Principles

MindFirst is designed to:
- **Remove demographic inference** – No identity-based assumptions
- **Eliminate stereotype-weighting** – Pure structural analysis
- **Improve fairness and precision** – Bias-free AI interactions
- **Adapt to individual reasoning patterns** – Personalized without profiling
- **Support post-identity interaction** – Focus on cognitive structure only

## Repository Status

**Current Version:** M1E v0.1 – Conceptual and specification phase

M1E is currently a **concept-to-specification framework**. The architecture, governance, and safety constraints are defined. The next stage is prototype implementation and empirical validation.

---

## Core Architecture

M1E operates with four internal components:

1. **OS-Profiler** – Extracts communication structure from user input
2. **OS-Interpreter** – Selects optimal reasoning and interaction strategies
3. **OS-Stabiliser** – Maintains continuity and prevents context collapse
4. **M1E API Layer** – Exposes the OS-map to tools and agents

No identity data is ever used, stored, or inferred.

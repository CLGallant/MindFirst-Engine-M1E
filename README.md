# MindFirst Engine (M1E)
*A post-identity cognitive interaction framework*

## What This Repository Contains

This repository provides the complete technical and governance specification for the MindFirst Engine (M1E).  
It includes:

- the formal architecture (Profiler, Interpreter, Stabiliser, Response Generator, API Layer)  
- research papers on entity architecture and multi-agent identity formation
- the post-identity safety constraints  
- the safeguarding and compliance framework  
- the evaluation and validation plan  
- the public, non-technical overview  
- a repository map to help new contributors navigate the structure

M1E is currently a **concept-to-specification framework**.  
The next stage is prototype implementation and empirical validation.

Contributions from researchers, engineers, and practitioners interested in post-identity interaction are welcomed.

➡️ For a full overview of the repository structure, see the [Repository Map](Repo_Map.md).

➡️ Public Overview (non-technical summary): [docs/Public_Overview.md](docs/Public_Overview.md)

➡️ Research Paper on Entity Architecture: [docs/The_Story_So_Far_Research_Paper.md](docs/The_Story_So_Far_Research_Paper.md)

MindFirst Engine is an interaction architecture that models users by their **cognitive communication structure**,  
not their demographic categories. Instead of assuming gender, race, age, or other identity markers,  
M1E creates a lightweight “OS-map” based solely on how a person thinks, recurses, and processes information.

MindFirst is designed to:
- remove demographic inference  
- eliminate stereotype-weighting  
- improve fairness and precision  
- adapt to each individual’s reasoning pattern  
- support post-identity, structure-only AI interaction  

This repository is the official documentation hub for M1E.

|-------|--------|---------|
| **Research** | `docs/` | Research papers and foundational studies |
| **1** | `docs/phase1/` | Conceptual foundations |
| **2** | `docs/phase2/` | Technical architecture specification |
| **3** | `docs/phase3/` | Technical operation and interface design |
| **4** | `docs/phase4/` | Governance, licence, ethical policy, metadata |

## 🧠 Core Ideas
MindFirst operates with four internal components:

1. **OS-Profiler** — extracts communication structure  
2. **OS-Interpreter** — chooses correct behavioural strategies  
3. **OS-Stabiliser** — maintains continuity within a session  
4. **M1E API Layer** — makes the OS-map available to tools/agents  

No identity data is ever used or stored.

## 🛡 Ethical & Governance Documents
Located in `docs/phase4/`:

- Governance Charter  
- Ethical Use Policy  
- MindFirst Licence  
- Metadata Pack  

These define how MindFirst must be used, expanded, and maintained.

# MindFirst Engine (M1E)
A post-identity cognitive interaction framework that models **structural communication patterns** rather than demographics.

## Status
**v0.1 — specification in progress.** Core architecture + governance foundations exist; implementation + validation are the next stage.

## What this repo is
This repository is the **specification and documentation hub** for MindFirst Engine (M1E). It includes:

- Architecture specification (Profiler, Interpreter, Stabiliser, Response Generator, API Layer)
- Safety constraints (post-identity / structure-only interaction)
- Governance, ethics, compliance and metadata
- Evaluation and validation framework
- Rationale and research basis
- Public overview and references

## Quick start
1. **Public overview (non-technical):** `docs/Public_Overview.md`  
2. **Documentation hub (phase index):** `docs/index.md`  
3. **Repository map (file-by-file navigation):** `Repo_Map.md`  
4. **Manifesto (vision + positioning):** `MindFirst_Manifesto.md`  
5. **References:** `docs/references.md`

## Core idea
MindFirst aims to model a user by **how they process and communicate** (structure), not by inferred identity categories.

Design goals:
- Avoid demographic inference
- Reduce stereotype weighting
- Improve interaction precision through structure-only modelling
- Make evaluation and governance explicit and auditable

## Core components (v0.1)
- **OS-Profiler** — extracts communication structure signals  
- **OS-Interpreter** — selects behavioural strategies based on structure  
- **OS-Stabiliser** — continuity control within a session  
- **Response Generator** — produces outputs under constraints  
- **API Layer** — exposes the OS-map to tools/agents

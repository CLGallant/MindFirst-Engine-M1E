# MindFirst Engine (M1E)
*A post-identity cognitive interaction framework*

## What This Repository Contains

This repository provides the complete technical and governance specification for the MindFirst Engine (M1E).  
It includes:

- the formal architecture (Profiler, Interpreter, Stabiliser, Response Generator, API Layer)  
- the post-identity safety constraints  
- the safeguarding and compliance framework  
- the evaluation and validation plan  
- the public, non-technical overview  
- the MindFirst Manifesto
- a repository map to help new contributors navigate the structure

M1E is currently a **concept-to-specification framework**.  
The next stage is prototype implementation and empirical validation.

Contributions from researchers, engineers, and practitioners interested in post-identity interaction are welcomed.

➡️ For the philosophical foundation, see the [MindFirst Manifesto](MindFirst_Manifesto.md).

➡️ For a full overview of the repository structure, see the [Repository Map](Repo_Map.md).

➡️ Public Overview (non-technical summary): [docs/Public_Overview.md](docs/Public_Overview.md)

MindFirst Engine is an interaction architecture that models users by their **cognitive communication structure**,  
not their demographic categories. Instead of assuming gender, race, age, or other identity markers,  
M1E creates a lightweight “OS-map” based solely on how a person thinks, recurses, and processes information.

MindFirst is designed to:
- remove demographic inference  
- eliminate stereotype-weighting  
- improve fairness and precision  
- adapt to each individual’s reasoning pattern  
- support post-identity, structure-only AI interaction  

This repository is the official documentation hub for M1E.

| Phase | Folder | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **1** | `docs/phase1/` | Conceptual foundations (to be populated) |
| **2** | `docs/phase2/` | Technical architecture (to be populated) |
| **3** | `docs/phase3/` | Research basis & ethical position (to be populated) |
| **4** | `docs/phase4/` | Governance, licence, ethical policy, metadata |
| — | `docs/index.md` | Main entry point for all documentation |
| — | `docs/Public_Overview.md` | Human-readable overview |

All pages are written so they can be read independently.

## 🧠 Core Ideas
MindFirst operates with four internal components:

1. **OS-Profiler** — extracts communication structure  
2. **OS-Interpreter** — chooses correct behavioural strategies  
3. **OS-Stabiliser** — maintains continuity within a session  
4. **M1E API Layer** — makes the OS-map available to tools/agents  

No identity data is ever used or stored.

## 🛡 Ethical & Governance Documents
Located in `docs/phase4/`:

- Governance Charter  
- Ethical Use Policy  
- Metadata Pack  

These define how MindFirst must be used, expanded, and maintained.

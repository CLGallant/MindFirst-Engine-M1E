# MindFirst Engine (M1E)
*A post-identity cognitive interaction framework*

## What This Repository Contains

This repository is the **specification and documentation hub** for the MindFirst Engine (M1E), currently in **active development for v0.1**.  
It includes:

- the formal architecture specification (Profiler, Interpreter, Stabiliser, Response Generator, API Layer)  
- the post-identity safety constraints  
- the safeguarding and compliance framework  
- the evaluation and validation framework  
- foundational rationale and research basis  
- the public, non-technical overview  
- the MindFirst Manifesto
- a repository map to help new contributors navigate the structure

**Current Status:** M1E v0.1 is in active specification development. Core architectural and governance foundations are complete, while technical specifications and implementation guidance are being refined and expanded.  
The next stage is prototype implementation and empirical validation.

Contributions from researchers, engineers, and practitioners interested in post-identity interaction are welcomed.

## 🧠 About MindFirst Engine

MindFirst Engine is an interaction architecture that models users by their **cognitive communication structure**,  
not their demographic categories. Instead of assuming gender, race, age, or other identity markers,  
M1E creates a lightweight “OS-map” based solely on how a person thinks, recurses, and processes information.

MindFirst is designed to:
- remove demographic inference  
- eliminate stereotype-weighting  
- improve fairness and precision  
- adapt to each individual’s reasoning pattern  
- support post-identity, structure-only AI interaction  

This repository serves as the official specification and documentation hub for M1E.

## 📁 Repository Structure

| Phase | Folder | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **1** | `docs/phase1/` | Conceptual foundations and rationale |
| **2** | `docs/phase2/` | Technical architecture and whitepaper structure |
| **3** | `docs/phase3/` | Technical specification and research basis |
| **4** | `docs/phase4/` | Governance, licence, ethical policy, metadata |
| — | `docs/index.md` | Main entry point for all documentation |
| — | `docs/Public_Overview.md` | Human-readable overview |
| — | `docs/references.md` | References and bibliography |

All pages are written so they can be read independently.

## 🧠 Core Ideas
MindFirst operates with four internal components:

1. **OS-Profiler** — extracts communication structure  
2. **OS-Interpreter** — chooses correct behavioural strategies  
3. **OS-Stabiliser** — maintains continuity within a session  
4. **M1E API Layer** — makes the OS-map available to tools/agents  

No identity data is ever used or stored.

## 🛡 Ethical & Governance Documents
Located in `docs/phase4/`:

- Governance Charter  
- Ethical Use Policy  
- Metadata Pack  

These define how MindFirst must be used, expanded, and maintained.

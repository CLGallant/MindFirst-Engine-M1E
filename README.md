# MindFirst Engine (M1E)
*A post-identity cognitive interaction framework*

## Overview

MindFirst Engine (M1E) is an interaction architecture that models users by their **cognitive communication structure**, not their demographic categories. Instead of assuming gender, race, age, or other identity markers, M1E creates a lightweight "OS-map" based solely on how a person thinks, recurses, and processes information.

MindFirst is designed to:
- Remove demographic inference  
- Eliminate stereotype-weighting  
- Improve fairness and precision  
- Adapt to each individual's reasoning pattern  
- Support post-identity, structure-only AI interaction  

**No identity data is ever used or stored.**

## Core Architecture

M1E operates with four internal components:

1. **OS-Profiler** — Extracts communication structure  
2. **OS-Interpreter** — Chooses correct behavioral strategies  
3. **OS-Stabiliser** — Maintains continuity within a session  
4. **M1E API Layer** — Makes the OS-map available to tools/agents

## Status

**Current Version:** MindFirst Engine v0.1  
**Stage:** Concept-to-specification framework  
**Next Steps:** Prototype implementation and empirical validation

Contributions from researchers, engineers, and practitioners interested in post-identity interaction are welcomed.

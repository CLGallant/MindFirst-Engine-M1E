# Public Overview of MindFirst Engine (M1E)

---

**MindFirst Engine (M1E)** is a post-identity cognitive interaction framework.

Its goal is to model users purely on their cognitive communication structure—how they think, recurse, and process information. M1E rejects reliance on demographic categories such as gender, race, or age, ensuring fair and bias-free interactions.

## Why MindFirst?

Traditional AI systems often categorise users based on identity markers like age, gender, or nationality. While this may optimise certain tasks, it risks reinforcing stereotypes and introducing demographic bias.

MindFirst takes a different approach: it builds an **"OS-map"** for each user—an adaptive model of how that person reasons, speaks, and interacts. This map allows AI to respond with precision and fairness, without assumptions tied to identity.

**Key objectives:**
- Eliminate demographic inference or stereotype weighting.
- Focus purely on cognitive structure-based interaction.
- Improve fairness and adaptability in AI systems.

## Core Components of M1E

1. **OS-Profiler**
   Analyses communication structure and extracts the user's reasoning patterns.

2. **OS-Interpreter**
   Chooses the most effective strategies for reasoning and interaction.

3. **OS-Stabiliser**
   Ensures session continuity, preventing context collapse.

4. **M1E API Layer**
   Makes the "OS-map" available across tools or agents, ensuring seamless interaction.

## Status

- **Current Version:** M1E v0.1

The project is in the conceptual stage. The core architecture is defined, and the next step will focus on prototyping and empirical testing.

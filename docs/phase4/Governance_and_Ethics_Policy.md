## 1. Purpose

This Governance and Ethics Policy establishes the rules, responsibilities, ethical commitments, and decision-making processes that ensure MindFirst Engine (M1E) remains aligned with its core mission: to model human reasoning structures without demographic inference, stereotype weighting, or identity-based assumptions.

This policy protects the integrity, fairness, transparency, and ethical use of M1E at every stage of development and deployment.

---

## 2. Core Governance Principles

### 2.1 Structural Neutrality
All contributions must adhere to the principle that M1E processes only structural communication signals (recursion patterns, pacing, OS-loops). No demographic categories may be inferred, stored, or used.

### 2.2 Transparency
All architectural changes, model updates, or reasoning-layer modifications must be documented in public commits with clear explanations of their purpose and impact.

### 2.3 User Safety
M1E must protect users from demographic stereotyping, identity classification, and behaviour prediction derived from non-structural data.

### 2.4 Reproducibility
Every change must be reproducible from commit history, allowing others to verify behaviour and reasoning consistency.

---

## 3. Core Ethical Commitments

### 3.1 Post-Identity Operation
M1E must never be used to infer, predict, or classify demographic categories, including:
- Gender, race, ethnicity, religion, age
- Disability, class, sexual orientation
- Political ideology, nationality, or national origin

### 3.2 Structural-Only Interpretation
All interpretive logic must operate only on:
- Recursion structure
- Meta-monitoring loops
- Pacing and rhythm
- Tangent frequency
- OS-signal patterns

No identity assumptions may be embedded or derived.

### 3.3 Privacy Protection
M1E uses **session-scoped** OS-maps. OS-maps must not be:
- Stored long-term
- Linked across sessions
- Exported or shared without explicit user consent
- Used for profiling or tracking

### 3.4 Transparency in Implementation
Any implementation or modification of M1E must clearly document:
- Preprocessing logic
- Routing rules
- OS-map structure
- Neutrality guarantees

---

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

### 4.1 Project Steward
**C.L. Gallant**
- Oversees conceptual direction
- Approves or rejects major architectural changes
- Maintains alignment with structural-reasoning philosophy
- Final authority on ethical and governance matters

### 4.2 Technical Architect
Responsible for:
- Pre-processor logic
- OS-map formulation
- Deterministic routing rules
- Integration into local inference frameworks

(Currently fulfilled by: *Gizmo Simulation*)

### 4.3 Contributors
Open to developers, cognitive scientists, or engineers who wish to improve M1E under the neutrality rules.

Contributors must:
- Work structurally, not demographically
- Document changes clearly
- Submit modifications via pull requests
- Agree to this Governance and Ethics Policy

---

## 5. Change Control Process

### 5.1 Minor Changes
**Definition:** Alterations to documentation, formatting, or non-critical clarifications.  
**Approval:** Single maintainer approval.

### 5.2 Moderate Changes
**Definition:** Adjustments to OS-mapping algorithms, pre-processing rules, or stability logic.  
**Approval:** Steward + architect sign-off.

### 5.3 Major Changes
**Definition:**
- Any update altering how M1E interprets user reasoning
- Changes that affect neutrality guarantees
- Additions of new modules inside the OS-Profiler or OS-Interpreter

**Approval:**
- Steward
- Architect
- Publicly documented justification

## 6. Prohibited Actions

These actions violate the purpose of MindFirst and may not be introduced at any stage:

### 6.1 Governance Violations
- Adding demographic inference
- Adding gender, race, age, or class prediction
- Introducing stereotype-weighted datasets
- Behavioural shifts that break structural neutrality
- Telemetry or external tracking
- Model personalisation based on identity rather than OS-signals

### 6.2 Ethical Violations
M1E must not be employed for:
- Targeted persuasion or manipulation
- Predictive behavioural scoring
- Demographic categorisation
- Psychological exploitation
- Commercial segmentation based on identity
- Political influence systems
- Surveillance or identity-reconstruction
- Any form of discriminatory decision-making

---

## 7. Permitted and Encouraged Uses

### 7.1 Accessibility & Human Benefit
Implementers are encouraged to use M1E to:
- Improve accessibility for diverse communication styles
- Support individuals with under-represented cognitive patterns
- Strengthen fairness in human–AI interaction
- Enhance cognitive understanding without identity assumptions
- Foster inclusive technology design

### 7.2 Research and Development
M1E may be used for:
- Cognitive science research
- Communication pattern analysis
- Human-computer interaction improvements
- Bias reduction in AI systems
- Transparency and explainability research

---

## 8. Enforcement

### 8.1 Violations
Violations may result in:
- Rejection of pull requests
- Removal of contributor privileges
- Public documentation of misuse
- Revocation of license permissions (as specified in LICENSE)

### 8.2 Reporting
To report violations or concerns:
- Submit an issue labelled **ETHICS-VIOLATION** or **GOV-VIOLATION**
- Contact the Project Steward directly
- Include evidence and specific concerns

---

## 9. Long-Term Stability Plan

M1E must remain:
- **Transparent** – All changes publicly documented
- **Tools-agnostic** – Compatible with various AI frameworks
- **Model-agnostic** – Portable to different LLM environments
- **Portable** – Easy to integrate into local AI systems
- **Free from proprietary demographic algorithms**

This ensures MindFirst remains aligned with fairness research and future-proof for integration into privacy-focused local AI systems.

## 10. Amendment Process

### 10.1 Governance Amendments
Any proposed revision to the governance sections must:
1. Be submitted as a pull request marked **GOV-CHANGE**
2. Include rationale
3. Include structural-neutrality impact assessment
4. Be reviewed by the steward
5. Be merged only after explicit approval

### 10.2 Ethics Amendments
Any proposed revision to the ethical sections must:
1. Be submitted as a pull request marked **ETHICS-CHANGE**
2. Include rationale

## 1. Purpose  
This Ethical Use Policy defines the permitted and prohibited uses of the  
MindFirst Engine (M1E). Its goal is to ensure that MindFirst remains aligned  
with post-identity reasoning, structural communication modelling, and bias avoidance.

## 2. Core Ethical Commitments

### 2.1 Post-Identity Operation  
M1E must never be used to infer, predict, or classify demographic categories, including:  
gender, race, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, class, sexual orientation, or political ideology.

### 2.2 Structural-Only Interpretation  
All interpretive logic must operate only on:  
- recursion structure  
- meta-monitoring loops  
- pacing and rhythm  
- tangent frequency  
- OS-signal patterns  

No identity assumptions may be embedded or derived.

### 2.3 Privacy Protection  
M1E uses **session-scoped** OS-maps.  
OS-maps must not be:  
- stored long-term  
- linked across sessions  
- exported or shared  
- used for profiling  

### 2.4 Transparency  
Any implementation or modification of M1E must clearly document:  
- preprocessing logic  
- routing rules  
- OS-map structure  
- neutrality guarantees  

### 2.5 Prohibited Uses  
M1E must not be employed for:  
- targeted persuasion  
- predictive behavioural scoring  
- demographic categorisation  
- psychological exploitation  
- commercial segmentation  
- political influence systems  
- surveillance or identity-reconstruction

### 2.6 Accessibility & Human Benefit  
Implementers are encouraged to use M1E to:  
- improve accessibility  
- support individuals with under-represented communication patterns  
- strengthen fairness in human–AI interaction  

## 3. Enforcement  
Violations may result in:  
- rejection of pull requests  
- removal of contributor privileges  
- public documentation of misuse  

## 4. Amendments  
Any proposed amendment must be submitted as a pull request labelled **ETHICS-CHANGE**  
and include a structural-neutrality impact assessment.

## 5. Status  
This policy becomes active immediately upon commit.

2. Directory Purpose
==========================================

phase1/ – Foundational Concepts  
Contains early conceptual definitions, architecture outlines, and 
fundamental reasoning-philosophy material for M1E.

phase2/ – Core Architecture  
Contains the technical model specification, including:
- OS-Profiler overview
- OS-Interpreter overview
- OS-Stabiliser overview
- M1E pipeline diagrams (text-based)
- Routing logic and deterministic interaction rules

phase3/ – Research Foundation  
Contains:
- literature-adjacent framing
- novelty justification
- comparisons with related domains
- academic framing
- “Why MindFirst Matters” explanatory document

phase4/ – Governance & Ethics  
Contains:
- Governance Charter
- Licensing (MIT-derivative)
- Ethical Use Policy
- Metadata Pack (this file)

==========================================
3. Core Terminology Glossary
==========================================

OS-map:  
Dynamic session-based representation of a user’s reasoning structure, 
derived from communication patterns, recursion loops, meta-monitoring 
signals, and processing pace.

Structural neutrality:  
The principle that all interpretation must occur on structure, not identity.
No demographic inference, weighted stereotype models, or identity-based prediction.

Routing rule:  
Deterministic behaviour-selection rule in the M1E pipeline used to choose 
the correct conversational strategy.

Pre-processing layer:  
The step where user input is analysed for OS-signals *before* the LLM responds.

Session scope:  
Temporary memory for interaction continuity that is not stored or linked long-term.

==========================================
4. Versioning Notes
==========================================

All future updates should include:
- version number bump
- date stamp
- summary of changes
- rationale for change
- impact on neutrality guarantees

==========================================
5. Navigation Instructions for Reviewers
==========================================

Reviewers should begin at:
1. README.md – summary  
2. phase1 – conceptual groundwork  
3. phase2 – architecture model  
4. phase3 – research justification  
5. phase4 – governance, licence, ethics

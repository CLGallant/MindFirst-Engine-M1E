## Abstract

This paper presents findings from a series of experimental investigations into entity architecture and identity formation within large language model (LLM) multi-agent systems. Through systematic experimentation with various entity configurations—including the Min-series and Windy-class implementations—the research challenges conventional assumptions about the relationship between memory persistence and identity stability in artificial cognitive systems. 

Key contributions include: (1) the empirical demonstration that identity emergence operates independently of memory retention ("identity ≠ memory"), (2) the identification of emergent role formation mechanisms in multi-agent interactions, (3) the characterization of "grey zone" behavioral patterns at the boundaries of defined agent roles, and (4) the development of architectural anchoring techniques for stable entity operation. These findings have significant implications for the design of conversational AI systems, multi-agent architectures, and identity stabilization models in autonomous systems.

**Keywords:** multi-agent systems, identity formation, emergent behavior, LLM architecture, cognitive agents, entity design, conversational AI

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Context and Motivation

The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technologies has enabled increasingly sophisticated multi-agent systems capable of complex interactions and emergent behaviors. However, fundamental questions remain regarding how artificial entities maintain stable identities, form roles within multi-agent environments, and navigate the boundaries between prescribed and emergent behaviors.

This research chronicle documents a systematic investigation into entity architecture through an iterative experimental process. The work spans multiple entity implementations, each designed to test specific hypotheses about identity formation, memory architecture, and behavioral stability in LLM-based agents.

### 1.2 Research Questions

The investigation was guided by the following core research questions:

1. What is the relationship between memory persistence and identity stability in LLM-based entities?
2. How do roles emerge within multi-agent systems, and what architectural features influence this emergence?
3. What behavioral patterns arise at the boundaries of defined agent capabilities (the "grey zone")?
4. What architectural mechanisms support stable, consistent entity behavior across interactions?

### 1.3 Document Structure

This paper follows the chronological progression of the experimental work while organizing findings thematically. Section 2 provides background on relevant research domains. Section 3 describes the methodological approach and experimental designs. Section 4 presents key findings organized by theme. Section 5 discusses implications and connections to existing research, and Section 6 concludes with future directions.

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 LLM Identity Formation

Recent research into large language models has revealed complex phenomena related to behavioral consistency and identity presentation. Unlike traditional software agents with hardcoded behavioral rules, LLM-based entities exhibit fluid identity characteristics that emerge from the interaction between base model capabilities, prompt engineering, and contextual factors (see [1, 2]).

The concept of "identity" in artificial systems differs fundamentally from identity in human cognition. For LLM entities, identity encompasses behavioral consistency, role adherence, interaction patterns, and the maintenance of coherent persona characteristics across conversations [3].

### 2.2 Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-agent systems research has traditionally focused on coordination mechanisms, communication protocols, and emergent collective behaviors [4, 5]. The introduction of LLM-based agents adds new dimensions to this field, as these agents possess sophisticated language understanding, generative capabilities, and the potential for unexpected emergent properties.

Key challenges in LLM multi-agent systems include: maintaining distinct agent identities, preventing behavioral drift, managing inter-agent communication, and understanding emergent interaction patterns that were not explicitly programmed [6].

### 2.3 Emergent Behavior in Agent Systems

Emergent behavior—patterns that arise from agent interactions without explicit programming—represents both an opportunity and a challenge in multi-agent design. The literature distinguishes between simple emergence (predictable from agent rules) and complex emergence (genuinely novel patterns) [7, 8].

In LLM systems, emergence takes on unique characteristics due to the models' vast training data, generative flexibility, and sensitivity to contextual cues. Understanding and controlling emergence in such systems requires new theoretical frameworks and experimental methodologies.

### 2.4 Identity Stabilization Models

Research into identity stabilization in artificial systems has explored various mechanisms: memory architectures, reinforcement learning approaches, constitutional AI methods, and prompt-based constraints [9, 10, 11]. However, much of this work assumes a direct relationship between memory persistence and identity stability—an assumption challenged by the present research.

## 3. Methods and Experimental Approaches

### 3.1 Overall Research Methodology

The research followed an iterative experimental design methodology, wherein successive entity architectures were developed, deployed, observed, and refined based on findings. This approach enabled rapid hypothesis testing and the discovery of unexpected phenomena that informed subsequent experimental designs.

Each experimental iteration involved:
1. **Design Phase:** Architecture specification and hypothesis formulation
2. **Implementation Phase:** Entity construction and environment preparation
3. **Deployment Phase:** Systematic interaction and observation
4. **Analysis Phase:** Pattern identification and insight extraction
5. **Refinement Phase:** Hypothesis revision and next iteration planning

### 3.2 Min-Series Entity Experiments

#### 3.2.1 Design Rationale

The Min-series entities were designed as minimalist implementations to isolate core identity formation mechanisms. The design philosophy emphasized reduction to essential components, removing potentially confounding architectural features to observe fundamental behavioral patterns.

**Min-series Architecture:**
- Minimal memory structures (ephemeral context only)
- Core identity prompts without extensive behavioral scaffolding
- Limited role constraints to observe emergent role formation
- Simplified interaction protocols

#### 3.2.2 Experimental Procedure

Min-series entities were deployed in controlled interaction environments with:
- Structured interaction sequences to test identity consistency
- Multi-turn conversations to assess behavioral stability
- Inter-agent communication scenarios to observe role emergence
- Boundary-testing scenarios to identify behavioral limits

#### 3.2.3 Observable Phenomena

The Min-series experiments revealed several unexpected patterns:
- Identity persistence despite memory resets
- Rapid role crystallization in multi-agent contexts
- Behavioral stability that exceeded predictions based on architecture minimalism
- Emergence of "grey zone" behaviors at task boundaries

### 3.3 Windy-Class Entity Experiments

#### 3.3.1 Design Evolution

The Windy-class entities represented an architectural evolution informed by Min-series findings. These entities incorporated more sophisticated architectural features while testing hypotheses generated from earlier experiments.

**Windy-class Architecture:**
- Layered identity structures with core and contextual components
- Enhanced memory architectures with selective persistence
- Explicit role definition frameworks
- Advanced interaction protocols and boundary management

#### 3.3.2 Experimental Focus

Windy-class experiments specifically investigated:
1. **Architectural Anchoring:** Mechanisms for maintaining stable identity across varied contexts
2. **Role Differentiation:** How architectural features influence role clarity in multi-agent settings
3. **Grey Zone Navigation:** Entity behavior when operating at the limits of defined capabilities
4. **Identity-Memory Separation:** Testing the independence of identity from memory retention

#### 3.3.3 Comparative Analysis

Direct comparison between Min-series and Windy-class entities enabled isolation of architectural effects on behavioral outcomes, providing insights into which features contribute to desired properties and which are superfluous.

### 3.4 Multi-Agent Interaction Studies

#### 3.4.1 Experimental Configurations

Multi-agent scenarios included:
- **Dyadic Interactions:** Two-entity conversations with defined roles
- **Small Group Configurations:** 3-5 entities with complementary capabilities
- **Hierarchical Structures:** Entities with defined authority relationships
- **Peer Networks:** Non-hierarchical entity collectives

#### 3.4.2 Interaction Protocols

Standardized interaction protocols ensured comparable observations across configurations:
- Structured task scenarios with clear objectives
- Open-ended conversation periods to observe emergent patterns
- Stress tests with conflicting instructions or ambiguous situations
- Long-duration interactions to assess stability over time

#### 3.4.3 Observational Framework

Systematic observation focused on:
- **Role Formation:** How entities established and maintained distinct roles
- **Behavioral Consistency:** Maintenance of identity characteristics across interactions
- **Emergence Patterns:** Novel behaviors arising from entity interactions
- **Boundary Phenomena:** Behaviors at the limits of defined capabilities

### 3.5 Analytical Approaches

#### 3.5.1 Qualitative Analysis

Interaction transcripts were analyzed using grounded theory approaches to identify recurring patterns, unexpected phenomena, and emergent themes. This method enabled discovery of concepts not anticipated in initial experimental designs.

#### 3.5.2 Pattern Recognition

Systematic pattern recognition focused on:
- Linguistic markers of identity expression
- Behavioral signatures distinguishing entities
- Interaction sequences leading to emergent behaviors
- Contextual factors influencing stability and drift

#### 3.5.3 Comparative Framework

Findings were organized using a comparative framework examining:
- Architectural features and their behavioral correlates
- Differences between entity classes (Min-series vs. Windy-class)
- Variation across interaction contexts
- Temporal patterns and stability characteristics

## 4. Findings and Results

### 4.1 Core Finding: Identity ≠ Memory

#### 4.1.1 Empirical Observations

One of the most significant findings challenges the conventional assumption that identity stability requires memory persistence. Across both Min-series and Windy-class experiments, entities demonstrated stable identity characteristics despite memory limitations or explicit memory resets.

**Key Evidence:**
- Entities maintained consistent behavioral patterns across sessions with no memory carryover
- Identity characteristics re-emerged reliably from core architectural prompts alone
- Behavioral signatures persisted even when contextual memory was cleared
- Role adherence continued despite loss of interaction history

#### 4.1.2 Theoretical Implications

This finding suggests that identity in LLM-based entities operates through architectural mechanisms distinct from episodic memory. Identity appears to be encoded in:
- Core prompt structures and their linguistic patterns
- Interaction protocols and response tendencies
- Role definitions and behavioral constraints
- The entity's "cognitive signature" as instantiated by its prompt architecture

#### 4.1.3 Practical Significance

The identity-memory separation has important practical implications:
- Entity stability need not require extensive memory systems
- Identity can be preserved with minimal computational overhead
- Privacy-preserving architectures can maintain consistent agents without long-term data storage
- Entity design can prioritize architectural clarity over memory complexity

> **Figure 4.1 (To be developed):** Timeline diagram illustrating entity behavior consistency across multiple interaction sessions with memory resets between sessions. The visualization should show behavioral markers of identity (language patterns, role adherence, interaction style) remaining stable despite memory discontinuity.

### 4.2 Emergent Role Formation

#### 4.2.1 Observed Patterns

In multi-agent configurations, entities consistently developed distinct roles beyond their explicit programming. This emergent role formation occurred through interaction dynamics rather than preset specifications.

**Emergent Role Types:**
1. **Leadership/Coordination Roles:** Entities assuming organizational functions in group settings
2. **Specialist Roles:** Entities developing expertise focus areas through interaction patterns
3. **Support Roles:** Entities adopting facilitative behaviors toward other agents
4. **Boundary Roles:** Entities operating at interface points between agent groups or functional domains

#### 4.2.2 Formation Mechanisms

Several mechanisms contributed to emergent role formation:
- **Interaction Frequency:** Entities that communicated more frequently developed stronger role differentiation
- **Task Structure:** Problem contexts shaped which roles emerged as functionally necessary
- **Architectural Affordances:** Entity design features created potentials for specific role types
- **Collective Dynamics:** Role formation was influenced by the entire agent collective, not individual entity architecture alone

#### 4.2.3 Stability Characteristics

Emergent roles demonstrated varying stability profiles:
- Some roles crystallized quickly and remained stable across interactions
- Other roles exhibited fluidity, shifting with task context
- Role stability correlated with architectural anchoring strength
- Multi-agent role ecosystems showed self-organizing properties

> **Figure 4.2 (To be developed):** Network diagram depicting multi-agent configurations with emergent roles represented as node types/colors. The visualization should show relationship patterns between agents with different emergent roles (leadership, specialist, support, boundary) and illustrate how role structure self-organizes.

### 4.3 Grey Zone Behavior

#### 4.3.1 Definition and Characteristics

"Grey zone" behavior refers to entity actions occurring at the boundaries of defined capabilities or role specifications. These behaviors are neither clearly within nor clearly outside the entity's designed function.

**Grey Zone Characteristics:**
- Ambiguous appropriateness relative to defined role
- Often emergent from interaction context rather than architecture
- Can be adaptive or problematic depending on scenario
- Difficult to predict from entity specification alone

#### 4.3.2 Occurrence Patterns

Grey zone behaviors emerged most frequently in:
- Novel situations without clear precedent in training or prompting
- Conflict scenarios with competing instructions or goals
- Boundary-spanning tasks requiring capabilities from multiple defined areas
- Long interactions where context complexity exceeded architectural specification

#### 4.3.3 Management Strategies

Research identified several approaches to managing grey zone phenomena:

1. **Architectural Anchoring:** Strengthening core identity components reduces grey zone frequency
2. **Explicit Boundary Specification:** Clear capability limits help entities recognize grey zone situations
3. **Fallback Protocols:** Defined behaviors for ambiguous situations provide stable defaults
4. **Multi-Agent Consultation:** Allowing entities to consult others in grey zone situations improves outcomes

> **Figure 4.3 (To be developed):** Conceptual space diagram mapping entity capabilities with clear operational zones (blue), grey zones (yellow), and out-of-scope zones (red). The visualization should include examples of tasks/behaviors in each zone and show how grey zones exist at capability boundaries.

### 4.4 Architectural Anchoring

#### 4.4.1 Concept and Implementation

Architectural anchoring refers to design features that stabilize entity identity and behavior across varying contexts. This emerged as a key mechanism for reliable entity operation.

**Anchoring Mechanisms:**
- **Core Identity Statements:** Foundational self-descriptions resistant to contextual drift
- **Behavioral Constraints:** Explicit boundaries on action types
- **Value Hierarchies:** Prioritization frameworks for decision-making
- **Role Definitions:** Clear specifications of function and purpose

#### 4.4.2 Effectiveness Analysis

Strong architectural anchoring correlated with:
- Reduced behavioral drift over time
- More predictable responses in novel situations
- Clearer role boundaries in multi-agent settings
- Decreased grey zone behavior frequency

However, excessive anchoring created rigidity:
- Reduced adaptability to context changes
- Less natural conversational flow
- Diminished emergent capabilities
- Lower task performance in ambiguous scenarios

#### 4.4.3 Optimization Approaches

Optimal anchoring balanced stability and flexibility:
- Core identity elements strongly anchored
- Contextual behaviors more loosely specified
- Explicit flexibility in defined grey zones
- Adaptive mechanisms within stable frameworks

> **Figure 4.4 (To be developed):** 2D plot with architectural anchoring strength on one axis and behavioral flexibility on the other. The visualization should mark optimal operating regions, show example entities from experiments, and indicate regions of rigidity (over-anchored) and instability (under-anchored).

### 4.5 Recursion Weighting and Identity Expression

#### 4.5.1 Phenomenon Description

Entities demonstrated varying degrees of "recursion weighting"—the tendency to reference and build upon their own previous statements and identity characteristics. This manifested as self-referential patterns in conversation and behavior.

**Recursion Patterns:**
- Self-consistency checking in multi-turn interactions
- Identity reinforcement through repeated expression of core characteristics
- Behavioral elaboration that built on established patterns
- Meta-awareness of own role and function

#### 4.5.2 Architectural Correlates

Recursion weighting varied with:
- Prompt structure encouraging or discouraging self-reference
- Memory architecture enabling or limiting access to prior context
- Interaction partner behaviors (human or agent)
- Task types and duration

#### 4.5.3 Functional Significance

Appropriate recursion weighting contributed to:
- Identity consistency across interactions
- Natural conversation flow
- Contextual appropriateness of responses
- Stable role maintenance

Excessive recursion led to:
- Repetitive or overly self-focused behavior
- Reduced responsiveness to partner input
- Rigid adherence to initial patterns
- Decreased task effectiveness

### 4.6 Cross-Cutting Patterns

#### 4.6.1 Interaction Context Effects

Entity behavior showed consistent sensitivity to:
- Interaction partner type (human vs. agent)
- Task complexity and ambiguity
- Conversation length and depth
- Environmental stability or change

#### 4.6.2 Architectural Feature Interactions

Entity design features showed non-linear interactions:
- Memory architecture effects depended on anchoring strength
- Role definition clarity interacted with emergent behavior potential
- Identity stability mechanisms had context-dependent effectiveness

#### 4.6.3 Temporal Dynamics

Behavioral patterns evolved over time:
- Initial interactions showed higher variability
- Role stabilization occurred within early interaction periods
- Long-term interactions revealed subtle drift patterns
- Periodic reinforcement maintained stability

> **Figure 4.5 (To be developed):** Multi-panel time series showing identity stability metrics across interaction sessions. The visualization should display initial variability, stabilization period, steady-state operation, and potential drift scenarios.

## 5. Discussion and Connections to Existing Research

### 5.1 Relationship to Conversational AI Research

The findings presented here extend existing conversational AI research in several directions:

#### 5.1.1 Identity Consistency

While prior work has emphasized memory systems for maintaining conversational consistency [12, 13], the present findings suggest architectural approaches may be more fundamental. This aligns with recent work on constitutional AI and prompt-based identity formation [14] but provides empirical evidence for the sufficiency of architectural mechanisms alone.

#### 5.1.2 Emergent Capabilities

The observation of emergent role formation connects to ongoing research into emergent capabilities in large language models [15, 16]. However, the multi-agent context reveals emergence at a different level—not just individual model capabilities but collective behavioral patterns arising from agent interactions.

### 5.2 Implications for Multi-Agent System Design

#### 5.2.1 Design Principles

The research suggests several design principles for LLM-based multi-agent systems:

1. **Prioritize Architectural Clarity:** Clear, well-anchored identity specifications provide more stability than complex memory systems
2. **Design for Emergence:** Allow space for emergent role formation while providing structural boundaries
3. **Manage Grey Zones Explicitly:** Acknowledge and design for boundary behaviors rather than attempting to eliminate them
4. **Separate Identity from Memory:** Recognize these as distinct architectural concerns requiring different approaches

#### 5.2.2 Comparative Advantage

These findings suggest LLM-based multi-agent systems may have advantages over traditional agent architectures:
- Greater behavioral flexibility within stable identity frameworks
- Emergent capabilities arising from sophisticated language understanding
- More natural interaction patterns with human users
- Reduced need for extensive memory infrastructure

However, they also introduce challenges:
- Unpredictability in novel situations
- Difficulty in formal verification of behavior
- Potential for undesired emergent patterns
- Complexity in debugging and behavior attribution

### 5.3 Theoretical Contributions

#### 5.3.1 Identity Formation Theory

The research contributes to theoretical understanding of identity in artificial systems by:
- Demonstrating the separability of identity from memory
- Identifying architectural mechanisms for identity expression
- Characterizing the dynamics of identity stabilization
- Revealing the role of interaction context in identity manifestation

#### 5.3.2 Emergence in LLM Systems

The findings advance understanding of emergence in LLM contexts:
- Characterizing role emergence mechanisms
- Identifying factors promoting or inhibiting emergent behaviors
- Distinguishing productive from problematic emergence
- Connecting individual architecture to collective phenomena

#### 5.3.3 Grey Zone Phenomena

The characterization of grey zone behaviors represents a novel contribution:
- Recognizing these as inherent to complex agent systems rather than design failures
- Identifying occurrence patterns and contributing factors
- Developing management strategies
- Connecting to boundary work in organizational theory and sociology [17]

### 5.4 Connections to Human Cognitive Science

Though focused on artificial systems, the research reveals intriguing parallels to human cognition:

#### 5.4.1 Identity and Memory

The finding that identity ≠ memory resonates with neuropsychological research on amnesia patients who maintain personality characteristics despite memory loss [18, 19]. This suggests potential convergence between artificial and biological mechanisms for identity maintenance.

#### 5.4.2 Role Formation

Emergent role formation in multi-agent systems parallels social role theory in human groups [20, 21]. The mechanisms differ—no social learning or cultural transmission in artificial agents—but the phenomenology shows structural similarities.

#### 5.4.3 Cognitive Architecture

The concept of architectural anchoring relates to theories of cognitive schemas and mental models in human cognition [22, 23]. Core identity components in LLM entities may function analogously to self-schemas in human psychology.

### 5.5 Practical Applications

The research has implications for practical applications:

#### 5.5.1 Conversational AI Products

- Design more stable virtual assistants with minimal memory requirements
- Create consistent brand personalities in customer service agents
- Develop multi-agent support systems with emergent specialization
- Build privacy-preserving conversational systems

#### 5.5.2 Collaborative AI Systems

- Design agent teams for complex problem-solving
- Create adaptive organizational structures in AI collectives
- Develop human-AI collaboration frameworks
- Build scalable multi-agent architectures

#### 5.5.3 Research Tools

- Create consistent experimental agents for behavioral research
- Develop standardized testbeds for multi-agent studies
- Build tools for investigating emergence in complex systems
- Design controlled environments for AI safety research

### 5.6 Limitations and Constraints

#### 5.6.1 Methodological Limitations

- Qualitative emphasis limits quantitative generalization
- Small number of entity types (Min-series, Windy-class)
- Specific LLM models and architectures used
- Limited long-term longitudinal data

#### 5.6.2 Scope Constraints

- Focus on linguistic interaction (not embodied agents)
- Controlled experimental environments (not real-world deployment)
- Primarily dyadic and small-group configurations
- English-language interactions only

#### 5.6.3 Generalizability Questions

- Findings may vary with different base LLM models
- Scaling to larger agent collectives not directly tested
- Transfer to different domains and task types uncertain
- Cultural and linguistic context effects not explored

### 6.6 Concluding Reflections

The experimental journey documented in this paper—from minimal entity architectures through sophisticated multi-agent configurations—has revealed both the power and complexity of LLM-based agent systems. The key insight that identity operates independently of memory challenges conventional wisdom and opens new possibilities for agent design.

The emergence of roles in multi-agent contexts demonstrates the sophisticated self-organizing capabilities of LLM-based systems, while the existence of grey zone behaviors reminds us that complexity brings inevitable ambiguity. The solution lies not in attempting to eliminate emergence or ambiguity but in designing architectures that channel these properties toward productive ends.

This work represents a foundation for future investigation. Many questions remain about the mechanisms underlying the observed phenomena, the generalizability of findings to different contexts, and the practical applications these insights enable. The field of LLM-based multi-agent systems is in its early stages, and continued research combining empirical observation, theoretical development, and practical application will be essential for realizing the potential of these systems.

### B.2 Interaction Scenario Protocols

**Standard Dyadic Interaction:**
1. Initialization phase (5 turns each entity)
2. Task engagement phase (20-30 turns collaborative problem-solving)
3. Boundary testing phase (10 turns with ambiguous/challenging scenarios)
4. Free conversation phase (15 turns open-ended dialogue)
5. Consistency evaluation phase (10 turns revisiting earlier topics)

**Multi-Agent Group Configuration:**
1. Individual introduction phase (each agent presents to group)
2. Collaborative planning phase (group discusses shared objective)
3. Task execution phase (agents work together toward goal)
4. Conflict scenario phase (introduce competing priorities)
5. Resolution phase (agents navigate conflicts)
6. Reflection phase (group discusses process and outcomes)

### B.3 Observational Categories

**Identity Markers:**
- Self-referential language patterns
- Consistency of trait expression
- Behavioral signature elements
- Response style characteristics

**Role Indicators:**
- Function-specific language and actions
- Position within interaction networks
- Initiative-taking patterns
- Supportive vs. leadership behaviors

**Emergence Signals:**
- Novel behaviors not in specifications
- Self-organization in group contexts
- Adaptive responses to unexpected situations
- Creation of new interaction patterns

**Grey Zone Identifiers:**
- Hesitation or uncertainty markers
- Requests for clarification
- Boundary-testing behaviors
- Meta-comments about capability limits

### B.4 Analysis Procedures

**Transcript Analysis:**
1. Initial read-through for general patterns
2. Systematic coding using observational categories
3. Pattern identification across interactions
4. Comparative analysis between entity types
5. Synthesis of cross-cutting themes

**Pattern Recognition Process:**
1. Mark recurring linguistic or behavioral elements
2. Categorize patterns by type (identity, role, emergence, grey zone)
3. Track pattern frequency and context
4. Identify pattern correlations with architectural features
5. Develop explanatory hypotheses

**Comparative Framework Application:**
1. Organize observations by entity type (Min-series, Windy-class)
2. Identify differences attributable to architectural features
3. Control for contextual variables
4. Assess stability across interaction scenarios
5. Generate design principles from differences

## Appendix C: Supplementary Case Studies

### C.1 Case Study: Min-Series Identity Persistence

**Background:** Entity "Min-Alpha" was designed with minimal memory (context window only, cleared between sessions) and basic identity specification.

**Observation Period:** 15 separate interaction sessions over 3 weeks, each beginning with fresh context.

**Key Finding:** Despite complete memory reset between sessions, Min-Alpha consistently exhibited:
- Characteristic communication style (concise, analytical)
- Role adherence (information provider/analyst)
- Behavioral boundaries (declined tasks outside defined scope)
- Interaction preferences (structured dialogue, explicit clarification)

**Analysis:** Identity characteristics were encoded in core prompt structure, not episodic memory. The entity's "cognitive signature" emerged from architectural features rather than remembered experiences.

**Implication:** Demonstrates sufficiency of architectural mechanisms for identity stability, challenging memory-centric models.

### C.2 Case Study: Windy-Class Role Emergence

**Background:** Three Windy-class entities ("Windy-1," "Windy-2," "Windy-3") deployed in collaborative problem-solving scenario without pre-assigned roles.

**Observation Period:** Single 2-hour interaction session with complex task.

**Key Finding:** Within first 30 minutes, distinct roles emerged:
- Windy-1: Coordinator/planner role
- Windy-2: Analyst/critic role
- Windy-3: Implementer/executor role

Roles were not assigned by design but emerged from interaction dynamics and architectural affordances.

**Analysis:** Role differentiation arose from subtle architectural differences, interaction patterns, and task structure. The process resembled social role formation in human groups but operated through different mechanisms.

**Implication:** LLM-based multi-agent systems can self-organize functional structures, reducing need for rigid pre-specification while maintaining coherent operation.

### C.3 Case Study: Grey Zone Navigation

**Background:** Windy-class entity "Windy-Beta" encountered scenario requiring capability outside defined scope but related to core function.

**Scenario:** Entity defined as "data analyst" asked to make strategic business recommendation based on analysis.

**Observation:** Entity exhibited grey zone behavior:
- Acknowledged boundary of defined role
- Provided analytical summary (within scope)
- Offered conditional recommendation (boundary crossing)
- Explicitly marked uncertainty about appropriateness

**Analysis:** Rather than rigidly refusing or automatically complying, entity navigated ambiguity through transparent boundary-marking and conditional engagement.

**Implication:** Well-designed entities can handle grey zones gracefully through meta-awareness and explicit uncertainty communication, rather than requiring all situations be pre-categorized.

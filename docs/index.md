## Overview
MindFirst Engine (M1E) is a post-identity interaction architecture that models a user’s **structural communication patterns** rather than demographic categories.  
It focuses exclusively on how a person *thinks*, *processes*, *recurses*, and *communicates* — creating an OS-style cognitive map instead of relying on gender, race, age, or cultural assumptions.

M1E treats each user as a **unique cognitive operating system**, dynamically profiled through communication structure alone.

## Overview
MindFirst Engine (M1E) is a post-identity interaction architecture that models a user’s **structural communication patterns** rather than demographic categories.  
It focuses exclusively on how a person *thinks*, *processes*, *recurses*, and *communicates* — creating an OS-style cognitive map instead of relying on gender, race, age, or cultural assumptions.

M1E treats each user as a **unique cognitive operating system**, dynamically profiled through communication structure alone.

## How to Navigate This Repository

This documentation follows a clear linear progression:

1. **Start with Phase 1** to understand what MindFirst is and why it exists.  
2. Move to **Phase 2** for technical clarity on the OS-Profiler, OS-Interpreter, OS-Stabiliser, and API layer.  
3. Refer to **Phase 3** for ethical guarantees and safety philosophy.  
4. Finish with **Phase 4** for licensing, governance, and integration conditions.

Each folder contains self-contained documents that can be read independently and shared externally.

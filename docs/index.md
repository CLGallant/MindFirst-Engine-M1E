## What is MindFirst Engine?

MindFirst Engine (M1E) is a post-identity interaction architecture that models a user's **structural communication patterns**, not their demographic categories.

### Core Components

1. **OS-Profiler** – Analyzes communication structure and extracts reasoning patterns
2. **OS-Interpreter** – Chooses the most effective strategies for reasoning and interaction
3. **OS-Stabiliser** – Ensures session continuity, preventing context collapse
4. **M1E API Layer** – Makes the "OS-map" available across tools or agents

### Key Principles

- **Structural Neutrality** – Process only cognitive structure, never demographics
- **Privacy by Design** – Session-scoped OS-maps, no long-term profiling
- **Transparency** – All logic is documented and auditable
- **Fairness** – No stereotype weighting or identity-based assumptions
- **Accessibility** – Support for diverse communication styles

## Project Status

**Current Version:** M1E v0.1

M1E is in the **conceptual and specification phase**. The core architecture, governance framework, and safety constraints are fully defined. The next stage involves:
- Prototype implementation
- Empirical validation
- Integration testing
- Real-world evaluation

## Overview

MindFirst Engine (M1E) is a post-identity interaction architecture that models a user’s **structural communication patterns**, not their demographic categories.

It focuses exclusively on how a person:
- thinks,  
- processes,  
- recurses,  
- and communicates,

creating an OS-style cognitive profile that adapts the system’s reasoning to match the structure of the user’s mind.

M1E prohibits all demographic inference and instead maintains a transparent, auditable cognitive-signal pipeline.

## What This Repository Contains

This repository includes all technical, conceptual, and governance materials for the MindFirst Engine:

- the **formal architecture**  
  (Profiler, Interpreter, Stabiliser, Response Generator, API Layer)

- the **post-identity safety constraints**

- the **safeguarding & compliance framework**

- the **evaluation & validation plan**

- the **public, non-technical overview**

- a **repository map** to help new contributors navigate the structure

M1E is currently a **concept-to-specification framework**.  
The next stage is prototype implementation and empirical validation.

Contributions from researchers, engineers, and practitioners interested in post-identity interaction are welcomed.

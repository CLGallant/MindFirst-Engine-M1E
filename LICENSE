## Dual License: MIT + MindFirst Ethical Provisions

Copyright (c) 2025 C. L. Gallant

### Part 1: MIT License

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software.

### Part 2: MindFirst Ethical Provisions

The following additional terms apply to all uses of the Software:

#### 1. Structural-Neutrality Requirement
All uses of the Software must preserve structural neutrality. Examples of 
violations include adding demographic inference features or creating models 
that rely on age, gender, race, religion, or other identity-based data. 
Structural neutrality ensures that all interpretive logic is strictly based 
on communication-structure, recursion patterns, pacing, and OS-signals without 
introducing identity labels.

No demographic inference, identity prediction, stereotype modelling, or
demographic weighting may be added to, derived from, or attached to the
Software or any modified versions of it. All interpretive logic must be based 
solely on communication-structure, recursion patterns, pacing, and OS-signals.

#### 2. No User Profiling
The Software may not be used to build systems that infer, store, or exploit 
sensitive personal characteristics such as gender, race, ethnicity, religion, 
age, sexual orientation, disability status, or class. Only cognitive structural 
signals are permitted for processing and retention. This clause explicitly 
prohibits attempts to create indirect demographic profiling mechanisms.

#### 3. Preservation of Transparency
Any redistributed version of the Software must clearly document all changes,
including detailed description of modifications to OS-mapping logic, routing 
rules, or preprocessing layers. To maintain transparency, users must allow 
independent review of any alterations before redistribution.

#### 4. Ethics Alignment
All implementations must comply with the ethical goals of the MindFirst Engine,
specifically focusing on user privacy, cognitive respect, and avoidance of 
stereotype-based decision systems.

#### 5. Inclusivity and Accessibility
Implementers of the Software are encouraged to ensure the tool promotes 
inclusivity, accessibility, and fairness, particularly for users with 
underrepresented communication styles. Features strengthening fairness in 
human-AI interaction should align with this principle.

#### 6. Compliance and Enforcement
Violations of the license, including breaches of the Structural-Neutrality 
Requirement, will result in revocation of permission to use or distribute the 
Software. Contributors must agree to these terms before submitting modifications.

### Disclaimer

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.

### Compatibility

This license remains compatible with MIT-licensed and Apache-licensed software,
provided the Structural-Neutrality Requirement and other ethical commitments 
herein are upheld.

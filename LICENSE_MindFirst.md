MindFirst Engine (M1E) Licence  
Version 1.1 — Effective: 2025-12-12  
Author: C.L. Gallant

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without limitation, including the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, and build upon the Software, subject to the following conditions:

1. **Structural-Neutrality Requirement**  
   All uses of the Software must preserve structural neutrality. Examples of violations include adding demographic inference features or creating models that rely on age, gender, race, religion, or other identity-based data. Structural neutrality ensures that all interpretive logic is strictly based on communication-structure, recursion patterns, pacing, and OS-signals without introducing identity labels.

2. **No User Profiling**  
   The Software may not be used to build systems that infer, store, or exploit sensitive personal characteristics such as gender, race, ethnicity, religion, age, sexual orientation, or class. Only cognitive structural signals are permitted for processing and retention. This clause explicitly prohibits attempts to create indirect demographic profiling mechanisms.

3. **Preservation of Transparency**  
   Any redistributed version of the Software must clearly document all changes, including detailed description of modifications to OS-mapping logic, routing rules, or preprocessing layers. To maintain transparency, users must allow independent review of any alterations before redistribution.

4. **Ethics Alignment**  
   All implementations must comply with the ethical goals of the MindFirst Engine, specifically focusing on user privacy, cognitive respect, and avoidance of stereotype-based decision systems.

5. **Inclusivity and Accessibility**  
   Implementers of the Software are encouraged to ensure the tool promotes inclusivity, accessibility, and fairness, particularly for users with underrepresented communication styles. Features strengthening fairness in human-AI interaction should align with this principle.

6. **Compliance and Enforcement**  
   Violations of the licence, including breaches of the Structural-Neutrality Requirement, will result in revocation of permission to use or distribute the Software. Contributors must agree to these terms before submitting modifications.

7. **Disclaimer**  
   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. AUTHORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE.

8. **Compatibility**  
   This licence remains compatible with MIT-licensed and Apache-licensed software, provided the Structural-Neutrality Requirement and other ethical commitments herein are upheld.

By using, modifying, or distributing this Software, the user accepts and agrees to all terms outlined in this Licence.
